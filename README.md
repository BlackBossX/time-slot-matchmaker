# Study Buddy

University students often face challenges such as difficulties in 
accessing course materials, managing group projects, and scheduling 
study sessions. Additionally, finding suitable study partners with 
compatible schedules can be challenging. This system aims to alleviate 
these issues by helping students find study partners based on their 
schedules. 








### _Streamlined working Process_:

This folder contains all the files necessary to run our project correctly. We created 
individual functions and then combined them into the final program. 
 


### We have files called : 

- main.c 
- studentInfo.c , studentInfo.h 
- filehandle.c , filehandle.h 
- timeslots. , timeslot.h 
- time_slots.csv 
- stu_database.csv 
- mainEXE.exe 
### To compile the Program : 




```bash
   gcc .\main.c .\timeslot.c .\filehandle.c .\studentInfo.c -o .\mainEXE.exe   
```
    
### Features:

- We used CSV files so that we can perform data analysis using Python libraries like 
    matplotlib, numpy, and pandas. 
 
### Process of the Program :
- When the program runs, it first prompts you to register in the system. 
- After that, you can either check existing time slots or add a new time slot. 
 
- You can proceed through each step by following the guidelines provided by the 
    program.
